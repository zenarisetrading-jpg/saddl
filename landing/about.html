            <h2 class="section-title">The Problem That Started Everything</h2>

            <div class="story-content">
                <p>I've been selling on Amazon for years. Built a 7-figure business. Spent hundreds of thousands on PPC.</p>

                <p>And for most of that time, I had no idea if my optimizations were actually working.</p>

                <p>Every week, I'd make bid changes. Block search terms. Launch new campaigns. Harvest keywords. I was doing the work. But when someone asked 'is all that PPC effort paying off?'—I couldn't really answer.</p>

                <p>I tried every tool out there. They all did the same thing: help me make more changes, faster. None of them answered the question I actually cared about:</p>

                <p class="story-highlight"><strong>Which of my optimizations actually worked?</strong></p>

                <p>I could look at overall ROAS, sure. But that doesn't tell you which decisions drove results. Did that bid increase help? Did those negative keywords save money? Or was it just market timing?</p>

                <p>So I built the tool I wished existed. That's AdPulse.</p>

                    <h3>Feedback loops change everything</h3>
                    <p>Without measurement, there's no learning. Without learning, there's no compounding. Most sellers make the same mistakes over and over because they never find out which decisions hurt them. AdPulse exists to close that loop.</p>

                <div class="belief-card">
                    <h3>Activity isn't the same as results</h3>
                    <p>The industry has convinced everyone that more optimizations = better performance. But volume of activity isn't quality of decisions. The best PPC managers aren't the ones who make the most changes—they're the ones who know which changes to make.</p>
